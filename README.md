# Object Oriented Principles

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
                -- Take what varies and "encapsulate" it, so it wont affect the rest of your code.

2. Program to an interface, not an implementation.
                -- Gives the advantages of, programming to supertype, i.e. polymorphism.

3. Favour Composition over Inheritance.
                -- Provides Delegation Feature, results in loose coupling of component.

4. Strive for loosely coupled designs, between objects that interact.

5. Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
                -- The Open Closed Principle
                
6. Depend upon abstractions, Do not depend upon concrete classes.
                -- The Dependency Inversion Principle
                
7. Principle of least knowledge: talk only to your immediate friends.
                -- For Any Objects, while designing a system, be careful the number of classes it interacts with.

8. Don't Call Us, We will Call You.
                -- The Hollywood Principle.

9. A class should have one, and only one reason to change.
