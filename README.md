1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
                -- Take what varies and "encapsulate" it, so it wont affect the rest of your code.

2. Program to an interface, not an implementation.
                -- Gives the advantages of, programming to supertype, i.e. polymorphism.

3. Favour Composition over Inheritance.
                -- Provides Delegation Feature, results in loose coupling of component.
